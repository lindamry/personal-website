          <div class="panel">
            <h5>Prepared by Sam Habiel for Electronic Health Solutions LLC</h5>
          </div>
          <p>This paper shows the ways in which you can establish internationalization and localization for VISTA. The following changes to support this are shown:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Creation of Generic Type of Patient and Eligibility</li>
              <li>Creation of a National ID field and its use as an identifier</li>
              <li>Display of dates in a dd/mm/yyyy (Little Endian) format instead of mm/dd/yyyy (Middle Endian) format</li>
              <li>Storage of the Arabic Name and indexing it for search and display in Mumps and CPRS</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Preliminaries</h2>
          <p>Unicode is not used for Arabic support; rather, I am using Windows-1256 (a.k.a. cp1256) for Arabic Encoding. The only change to support that in Mumps is setting the terminal emulator to input and display cp1256. For CPRS to display Arabic properly on Windows XP, go to Control Panel &gt; Regional and Language Options &gt; Advanced tab. Set the language in the drop down to Arabic (Jordan) and make sure that Code page conversion table 1256 (ANSI – Arabic) is checked.</p>
          <p>Unicode is the preferred approach, but CPRS doesn't operate with Unicode. However, all the Mumps changes are as applicable with Unicode as with cp1256.</p>
          <p>Two databases were used to test this example: One patched up to June 2008 (and using CPRS 26) and one patched up to March 2009 (the most up to date patches available) (and using CPRS 27).</p>
          <h2>Change Type of Patient, add Eligibility, and add National ID field</h2>
          <p>First, add the national ID field:</p>
          <pre>
Select FIELD: NATIONAL ID
LABEL: NATIONAL ID//

'HELP'-PROMPT: Answer must be 1-40 characters in length.
       Replace
XECUTABLE 'HELP':
          </pre>
        <p>Notice that the National ID field is stored in ^DPT(DA,"UJO0")</p>
        <p>Once this field is created, create a new patient type to replace "VISTA OFFICE EHR", which is an inappropriate term for users to see and may show up in several places. We will use "General Eligibility" or any other term instead.</p>

        <h2>Enabling searching for patients by Arabic Name and by National ID</h2>
        <p>Searching for Arabic Names should work out of the box since the Mnemonic index should take care of that. However, it turns out that there is an input transform in AUPNLK1I that is present to capitalize letters that is garbling the user input (due to how Mumps operates with ASCII encoding cp1256). In order to fix that, the following change needs to be made:</p>

        <h2>Display of Dates in Little Endian Format</h2>
        <p>The following instructions apply to the Mumps side. CPRS and other GUI applications do their own formatting; localizing these applications requires changing their code. You need the DIDT (named as %DT by the ^DINIT routine) routine found in Fileman 22.1037 or later for some bug fixes for some bugs I reported.</p>
        <p>Once the changes outlined below are done, the system will display and receive input in dd/mm/yyyy as long as the applications use the VISTA date APIs. The applications that don't use them will display dates typically in the mm/dd/yyyy format.</p>
        <p>The date support depends on the language file.</p>
        <p>Set the Default Language in the Kernel to be Arabic:</p>

        <p>Once that's set, Fileman APIs correctly allow input and write output in a proper format using the Language file.</p>
        <p>The other API in Vista that is extensively used for dates is in the Kernel's XLFDT routine. It does not check (currently) DUZ("LANG") in order to do proper processing. I made an edit to the routine to give it this support (just an additional one line, shown in bold).</p>
