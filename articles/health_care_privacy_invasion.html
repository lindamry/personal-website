  <h1>Healthcare privacy invasion by the Federal Government as part of ARRA Legistlation as implemented by CMS</h1>
      <div class="large-12 columns">
<p>
As part of the HJITECH Act which is part of the The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub.L. 111?5), eligible healthcare providers 
and hospital receive incentives to adopt electronic health records (EHRs) and to use them "meaningfully".  Part of the way "meaningful use " is proven it by using a Meaningful Use Certified EHR and to report performance on adherence to quality measures.  In addition to incentives, how much physicians are paid for services by Medicare and Medicaid is linked to reporting of quality measures but reporting of quality measures is not limited to Medicare and Medicaid patients.
</p>

<p>
Quality measure data is reported to the federal government though  the Department of Health and Human Services Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS, which is part of HHS) Provider Quality Reporting System (PQRS).  Currently, reports are submitted in the form of QRDA reports. There are two types of QRDA reports.  One is QRDA I which fully identifies patients by name, address, date of birth, etc., and provides specific data about the patient relative to a given quality measure, and the other is a summary report, is a QRDA III report.
</p>
<p>
As of what is called Meaningful Use Stage 3, only fully identified data on individuals, not summary data for patients, will be allowed to be reported.  The attached 3 documents show quality measures being collected by the federal government through PQRS and EHR inventive programs in 2015 and there will be more of them created every year.  These include depression screens and lead to the reporting of everyone who is screened and whether or not the depression screen was positive for age 12 and older (PQRS document, line 71, EH document page 17 line 2),  depression diagnosis (PQRS line 9 and EH page 12 line 3) identifying patients age 13 and older with drug or alcohol dependence (PQRS line 167, EH page 2 line 3 ), reporting BMI (line 68, EH document page 18 line 2), tobacco use (line 119 &amp; 256, EH page 4 line 2 ),  HIV status ( PQRS line 194 &amp; 222, EH page 15 line 4), LDL level ( PQRS line 172, EH line page 21 line 2 and page 22 line 2), A1C Hemoglobin level if patients are diabetic (PQRS line 3, EH page 6 ), mental health hospitalizations (PQRS line 245), coronary artery disease (PQRS line 6), breast feeding (EH page 2 line 2 ), etc.
