## Objectives

 * Identify at least one public drug drug interaction source; and discuss why there is a public health need for one.
 * Discuss the problem with classifying severeties on drug-drug interactions.
 * Identify ways to reduce alert fatigue due to drug-related alerts.

 * Far more interested in computers than drugs.
---
## Do you know this interaction?

 * Ribavarin / Zidovudine

Rated as critical in the program that we were using.

Resulted in phone calls.

* Rated as significant in the VA-NDF.
* Rated as Severe (2) in FDB.
---
## How about?

## Black box warning contraindicated comedications
Ann Pharmacother. 2010 Jan. doi: 10.1345/aph.1M475. PMID: 20040698.

 * To determine the level of agreement in presence, clinical severity scores level of documentation ratings, and alert content among 3 leading drug interaction screening programs with regard to contraindicated comedications that are mentioned in black box warnings.

--

 * We identified 11 drugs with black box warnings that contained information on 59 unique contraindicated drug combinations, only 68% of which were covered by any source. Lexi-Comp detected the most interactions (n = 29) and DRUG-REAX the least (n = 18). Only 3 drug combinations were detected and rated as contraindicated or potentially life-threatening in all 3 databases. The severity scores and level of documentation ratings varied widely.

## Ability of pharmacy clinical decision-support software to alert users about clinically important drug-drug interactions
J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2011 Jan-Feb doi: 10.1136/jamia.2010.007609. PMID: 21131607

--

 * Researchers made on-site visits to 64 participating Arizona pharmacies between December 2008 and November 2009 to analyze the ability of pharmacy information systems and associated CDS to detect DDIs.
 * The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and percentage of correct responses were measured for each of the pharmacy CDS systems.

--

 * Only 18 (28%) of the 64 pharmacies correctly identified eligible interactions and non-interactions. The median percentage of correct DDI responses was 89% (range 47-100%) for participating pharmacies. The median sensitivity to detect well-established interactions was 0.85 (range 0.23-1.0); median specificity was 1.0 (range 0.83-1.0); median positive predictive value was 1.0 (range 0.88-1.0); and median negative predictive value was 0.75 (range 0.38-1.0)

--

 * Community pharmacies failed to detect approximately one in 12 clinically significant DDIs, while hospital pharmacy systems failed to detect approximately one in four DDIs.

 * In addition, systems in other settings incorrectly categorized approximately one in seven of the DDIs evaluated.

---
## Pharmacist recognition of potential drug interactions
Am J Health Syst Pharm. 1999 Aug 1;56(15):1524-9. PMID: 10478990

* The subjects detected only 66% of the interactions in the 2-drug profiles, 34% of the interactions in the 4-drug profiles, 20% of the interactions in the 8-drug profiles, and 17% of the interactions in the 16-drug profile.

---

## Concordance of severity ratings provided in four drug interaction compendia
J Am Pharm Assoc (2003). 2004 Mar-Apr;44(2):136-41. PMID: 15098847.

 * Little agreement exists among commonly used drug interaction COMPENDIA for DDIs that were classified in fall 2001 as having the highest clinical relevance and importance.

---

## Comparison of critical drug-drug interaction listings: the Department of Veterans Affairs medical system and standard reference compendia
Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2010 Jan;87(1):48-51. doi: 10.1038/clpt.2009.198. PMID: 19890252

--

 * A list of critical DDIs, as defined by the VA, was compared with two standard commercially available compendia (Micromedex DRUG-REAX and Drug Interactions: Analysis and Management (DIAM)) in order to determine the level of agreement among the systems.
 * Of 982 DDIs classified as critical by the VA, only 136 DDIs (13.7%) were considered critical in all three systems.
 * VA has since switched to FDB, but made 44,000 changes to FDB data

---

## Inconsistencies and misleading information in officially approved prescribing information from three major drug markets.
Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2014 Nov;96(5):616-24. doi: 10.1038/clpt.2014.156. PMID: 25062063
 
 * Reciprocal warnings regarding drug-drug interactions that constitute contraindications were frequently missing in the SPCs of the drugs concerned (all countries >40%).

--

 * Most SPCs did not explicitly exclude adverse reactions considered not reasonably attributable to the use of the drug. 
 * Comparing SPCs of different generic brands of the same drug, only 60, 10, and 20% of the US, UK, and German SPCs, respectively, provided identical contraindications.

---

## Open source drug interaction compendia
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software>

* Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner.

--

* Advantage: Can actually study ALL interactions; not just pieces from here and there.
* Advantage: Typically internet based and available in multiple formats.

## What's out there?

## Toward a complete dataset of drug-drug interaction information from publicly available sources
J Biomed Inform. 2015 Jun;55:206-17. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2015.04.006. PMID: 25917055

* 15 Data sources

--
* Crediblemeds.org
* VA NDF-RT
* ONC High Priority
* ONC Non-interruptive
* OSCAR
* DDI Corpus 2011
* DDI Corpus 2013
* PK DDI Corpus

--
* NLM CV DDI Corpus
* KEGG DDI
* TWOSIDES
* DrugBank
* DIKB
* SemMedDB
* And... French ANSM dataset
(Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé)

--
For us, we are most interested in the ANSM, ONC lists, and VA NDF. Overlap statistics are interesting:

 * ANSM/VA NDF: 40% (from Dr. Richard Boyce)
 * ANSM/ONC HP: 25% (from Dr. Richard Boyce)
 * VA NDF/ONC HP: 20% (study)
 * VA NDF/ONC NI: 1.3% (study)

---

## ONC High Priority List
J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2012 Sep-Oct;19(5):735-43. doi: 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000612. PMID: 22539083

 * Drug-Ixn List sponsored by ONC that must be alerted by EHR vendors.

--

![ONC HP Table](./ONC-Table4.png)

--

Interesting Tidbits from this:

 * Low matching percentage from Open Source DDI Compendia
 * (we'll save this one to the end of the talk)
 * Gemfibrozil/Statins Interaction rated as critical, then downgraded.
 * Linezolid/Triptans rated as critical, but Vendors disagreed unanimously.

---

## ONC Low Priority List
J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2013 May 1;20(3):489-93. doi: 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001089. PMID: 23011124

An attempt by ONC to address the alert fatigue issue.

* Table 3 and Table 4

* NSAIDs vs BB and NSAIDs vs ACEI deemed low priority.

## Alert Overload has another component though (slides from Dr. Russ)
Applying human factors principles to alert design increases efficiency and reduces prescribing errors in a scenario-based simulation.

J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2014 Oct;21(e2):e287-96. doi: 10.1136/amiajnl-2013-002045.  PubMedID: 24668841

![Russ1](./russ-slide-15.png)

--

 * 19 alerts missed due to scrolling mechanism
 * 6 (30%) of prescribers
 * 2 critical drug-drug interactions

--

![Russ2](./russ-slide-20.png)

--

![Russ3](./russ-slide-13.png)

--

 * This was done on an open source EMR.
 * Can you do this kind of analysis on proprietary EMRs?

# Conclusion
 
 * Could Jack Nicolson have had Nitroglycerin infused safely?

## We are lucky! We have data to tell us.
Time-dependent interactions of the hypotensive effects of sildenafil citrate and sublingual glyceryl trinitrate.

Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2009 Apr;67(4):403-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2009.03375.x. PMID: 19371313.

* Mean reduction is SBP at 1 hour for angina patients is -16 (95% CI: -12 to -21)
* What's his blood pressure?
* I think it's safe to administer in an ER setting; not in an ambulatory setting.
 (but I don't remember anymore what is the appropriate treatment for Acute Angina).
* An EMR will alert you for a critical interaction here.
* ONC HP List decided to exclude PDE Inhibitors and Nitrates.

--
## My recommendations from my career:

 * EMRs needs to distinguish alerting from information provision.
 * Alerting should be done at the highest alert levels only.
 * However, the ordering interface should be much better at providing non-
   interruptive hints to providers at the point of ordering regarding expected drug interactions.
 * Investigations for drug interactions for patients should not use alert systems as a guide. Instead, a separate tool is needed.
