## Objectives

 * Identify at least one public drug drug interaction source; and discuss why there is a public health need for one.
 * Discuss the problem with classifying severeties on drug-drug interactions.
 * Identify ways to reduce alert fatigue due to drug-related alerts.

## Black box warning contraindicated comedications
Ann Pharmacother. 2010 Jan. doi: 10.1345/aph.1M475. PMID: 20040698.

 * To determine the level of agreement in presence, clinical severity scores level of documentation ratings, and alert content among 3 leading drug interaction screening programs with regard to contraindicated comedications that are mentioned in black box warnings.

--

 * We identified 11 drugs with black box warnings that contained information on 59 unique contraindicated drug combinations, only 68% of which were covered by any source. Lexi-Comp detected the most interactions (n = 29) and DRUG-REAX the least (n = 18). Only 3 drug combinations were detected and rated as contraindicated or potentially life-threatening in all 3 databases. The severity scores and level of documentation ratings varied widely.
