## What is RxNorm?

 RxNorm is a standardized vocabulary set for Drugs in the 
 United States. The goal of RxNorm is drug nomenclature 
 standardization and systems interoperability. More information 
 on RxNorm can be found at 
 <http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/>.

---

- RxNorm is necessary for interoperability with other systems.
- If you use VISTA alone without having to talk to any other system, then you don't need RxNorm. 
- However, if you perform external drug interactions, send CCDA documents, or archive patient records for CCR, you are going to need RxNorm. 
- For Meaningful Use, you are required to have RxNorm for various purposes.

<https://trac.opensourcevista.net/wiki/RxNormForVista>

---

- This release contains Fileman files corresponding to most of public domain RxNorm (archived data is not loaded into VISTA).
- It also contains utilities for querying RxNorm for specific information and a utility to add drugs to the drug files automatically based on an RxNorm number.

---

- This release is licensed under  AGPL v3.0 and is free as in free beer. 
- A commercial license for commercial entities running VISTA can be obtained for $2000 per VISTA instance. 
- Support costs for monthly updates are $100/month per VISTA instance both for AGPL and commercial users.
